# BREAKOUT_RIPOFF

A game based off the arcade Breakout video games. The game was made using turtle module. 


# HOW TO PLAY

Once the script is ran the game will simply start. The objective is to break as many walls as possible and get the highest score possible. 

# FUTURE IMPLIMENTATION 

1) To make it more similar to the break out game by making the paddle shrink to half size when the red blocks are reached. 
2) Make it the goal to set score based on color reach rather than just each block giving one point.
