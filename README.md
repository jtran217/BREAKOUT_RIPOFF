# BREAKOUT_RIPOFF

A game based off the arcade Breakout video games. The game was made using turtle module. 


# HOW TO PLAY

Once the script is ran the game will simply start. The objective is to break the walls to reach the other end.
Users have the option to simply aim straight fot the other end however, this would result in a lower score. Every 12 points the speed is increased to increase difficulty. 
If the user fails to catch the ball, it is GAME OVER

# FUTURE IMPLIMENTATION 

1) To make it more similar to the break out game by making the paddle shrink to half size when the red blocks are reached. 
2) Make it the goal to set score based on color reach rather than just each block giving one point. 
3) Return the score when player loses ball.
